1. Importance of style.xml file , here we should define the theme color because  these colors will be picked by the android, and uses as a theme colors that are
colorPrimary - > for app bar
colorPrimaryDark -> for status bar
colorAccent -> for UI components like checkbox, button , text other

this small add on really give an app a standard look.
